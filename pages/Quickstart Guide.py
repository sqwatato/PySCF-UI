st.title("Quickstart Guide")
st.write("This UI is intended to serve as an easy and intuitive way to perform self-consistent field calculations, thermodynamic analyses, and harmonic oscillator calculations for molecules using the PySCF library. Here are some instructions on how to use the current features of the UI.")
st.write("PySCF UI was created mainly for applications in organic, biochemical, and pharmaceutical synthesis. As such, all future updates and features will aim to combine general *ab initio* computational method features with aesthetic changes and specialized updates in line with these fields. However, the UI can be used for basic calculations and trend observations for any molecule.")
st.header("Selecting Molecular Geometries")
st.write("The UI allows for both custom *.xyz* or *.txt* file-type molecular geometries, as well as pre-loaded geometries. The available pre-loaded geometries can be found under the 'Database' tab in the input section, and have been sourced from the CCCBDB NIST database. The custom geometries can be entered in the 'Text Input' or 'File Input' tabs (also in the input section). In the 'Text Input' tab, the geometry must be copied and pasted into the textbox as the example shows. In the 'File Input' tab, any *.xyz* or *.txt* file can be inputted. Please note that the UI will throw errors if there are other pieces of information apart from the molecular geometry in the *.xyz* or *.txt* file.")
st.write("Future updates will expand the UI to allow for the selection of any *.xyz* file from the QM9 database, which includes 133885 molecular geometries and is a peer-reviewed database commonly used for ML network training.")

st.header("PySCF UI SCF Methods")
st.write("Currently, the UI offers two self-consistent field (SCF) methods: unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF), and unrestricted Kohn-Sham density functional theory (UKS). These are functions that are built into PySCF's *scf* and *dft* submodules. Future updates will extend this to the restricted versions of the two, as well as other post-Hartree-Fock methods built into PySCF. In line with the PySCF library, PySCF UI does not include non-SCF methods such as Hylleraas or Monte Carlo.")
st.write("To see the list of all methods offered by PySCF and get a quick introduction to PySCF, please click the User Guide link below:")
st.write("https://pyscf.org/user.html")
st.header("PySCF Basis Sets")
st.write("PySCF UI currently allows for users to select any of the basis sets built into the PySCF library (except for those in the old *Dyall's basis sets* submodule). These 340 basis sets are Gaussian-type orbital basis sets (PySCF does not have Slater-type orbital basis sets currently built into the library).")
st.write("Please note that not all of the basis sets exist for all the atoms; thus, the UI will throw an error if a basis set has not been found for a particular atom.") 
st.write("To see the list of all basis sets offered by PySCF and the atoms for which those basis sets are offered, please visit the link below:")
st.write("https://pyscf.org/_modules/pyscf/gto/basis.html")  
st.header("BSE Basis Sets")
st.write("PySCF UI also allows for users to select basis sets from the Basis Set Exchange (BSE). BSE is the most prominent basis set database in the field of quantum chemistry and provides access to hundreds of peer-reviewed, published basis sets. The UI allows users to select from 403 BSE basis sets that are available for C, H, N, O, F, S, and P. Future updates will extend this to all atoms up to Cl as well.")
st.write("The UI currently only supports running one basis set for the entire molecule, and does not support selecting different basis sets for different atoms in the molecule. Moreover, the UI also does not currently support custom basis sets. These will be included in future updates.")
st.write("For more information regarding BSE and the basis sets it offers, plase click the link below:")
st.write("https://www.basissetexchange.org/")
st.header("Verbose and PySCF Logs")
st.write("The verbose quantity refers to the amount of information displayed in the PySCF logs once the calculation is finished. These logs can be seen under the 'View Logs' tab in the output section. The minimum verbose level provided by the UI is 3; this is the bare minimum that provides the energy and runtime for the molecule. We recommend verbose 5 to get the runtime and energies for each cycle in the SCF calculation process; however, if you would like more data on the process, select a verbose value higher than 5. The maximum verbose value is 9.")
st.write("To see what features are provided at each verbose level, please visit the PySCF developer guide. To get a basic understanding of the features of PySCF (including verbose), please visit the PySCF User Guide (linked above).")
st.header("Comparative Graphs")
st.write("The comparative graphs, which can be viewed under the 'View Graphs' tab in the output section, allows the user to compare energy and runtime trends for the different molecules they have calculated, with respect to the number of carbons and the total number of atoms. In future updates, this feature may be extended to include trend graphs for thermodynamic and other data as well.")
